## Why Flowbuild?

## Reproducible

Each workflow created is the same and can be deployed to any running server.

## Independent

Each process runs independently from each other.

## Easy to explain and to reason about

The workflows are based of BPMN (Business Process Model and Notation), which represents
processes in a easy to follow manner. Furthermore, the business logic of the application
can be shown and expressed to people outside of the programming field, leading to better
communication.

## Install Flowbuild (Quick Install Guide)

### Install node

#### With node version manager (recommended)

There are multiple ways to install node. On macOS and Linux, the recommended way
is using `nvm` ([Click here for official page](https://github.com/nvm-sh/nvm)
). On Windows, you can run `nvm` using WSL or install node with the [official installer](https://nodejs.org/en/).

Once installed, you can check if it works by running:

```sh
node -v
```
